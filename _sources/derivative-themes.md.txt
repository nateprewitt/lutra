# Creating a derivative theme

Hello there! Happy to know that you're interesting creating a derivative theme!

## How to do it

Broadly, there's two options:

```{contents}
:local:
:class: this-is-redundant-but-useful
```

I would request that you do two things:

- Make sure to mention that the derived theme is based on Lutra, somewhere prominently on your project's README or other documentation.
- Make sure that you make it clear that the derived theme is different from Lutra.

### Forking Lutra

### Inheriting from Lutra
