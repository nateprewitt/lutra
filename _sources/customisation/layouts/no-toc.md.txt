# `no-toc` layout

This removes the sidebar that would contain the "on this page" table of contents and allows you to use the `full-width` directive to expand content into that region.

This page has a `no-toc` layout.

```{todo}
TODO: Provide the `full-width` directive to do this.
```

<div class="full-width">
This layout is useful if you want to present your documentation hierarchy, or when your documentation site is not the primary point of entry for your project.
</div>

If this layout is used, it is **strongly** recommended to ensure that you're still keeping content width at ~90 characters.
