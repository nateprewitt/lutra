# Kitchen Sink

This section exists as a dump of all the things that Sphinx has.

It has exactly one goal: to be a good checklist of things to stylise within Sphinx. This also means that it is a complete showcase of _everything_ that vanilla Sphinx provides and includes all sorts of edge cases.

Some of the content here builds upon [`sphinx-rtd-theme`'s demo documentation](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as well as [`docutils`' reference documentation](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/index.html#ref-reference-material-for-all-groups).
